# Trees on Numbers

## Project Abstract
_Trees on Numbers_ will be a contributing to the NumPy library mainly focusing on making more abstract data structures, higher level classes for vectors and functions relating to graph theory and implementing graphs. Inserting the new classes for those three objectives will be the main goal of the project. The motivation for this project is to make it easier to use NumPy library in other projects that needs graphs and vectors specifically. An example for this extension being useful is game renders or 2D graphic projects.

## Project Relevance
This extension will be using the object-oriented design since NumPy is in python and does use classes in API. It also will have test driven development since the functions of the classes could be tested for returning results even before writing them. Using debugging will be a possibility and made easy in python. The extension will be something that requires NumPy or made as a contribution to NumPy itself.

## Conceptual Design
The project will be mainly aimed to add/improve partially or fully of those three categories: data structures regarding graphs and trees, higher level classes/API for vectors in 2D and functions for algorithms relating to both vectors and graphs. The direct aim for the contribution is to make it easier to implement usage of trees and graphs and the most common algorithms used on those two structures as well as vectors. The contribution does not aim to mainly reimplement in the same way NumPy does it right now but try to improve it and make it easier and less abstract as it is right now.

## Background
The building of NumPy is easy and simple. Simply fork the repo and clone it into your computer and change the upstream. Those details are described more in detail in this URL: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/dev/
